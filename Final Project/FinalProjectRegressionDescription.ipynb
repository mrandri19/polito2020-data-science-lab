      "Clean as anyone should reasonably expect given the almost unheard-of price. It offers solid cherry and blackberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is round and totally inoffensive. Drink it now; cook with it; make a sangria with it. Just enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "This Châteauneuf-style wine is jammy, with black stone fruits, berries and dark chocolate, and a sweet black cherry core, but it has body and tannins to lend it weight. The winemaker suggests pairing it with cassoulet. New from Don Sebastiani & Sons.\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "Cleanly made, this plump, sweet wine offers simple pear flavors at an bargain price.\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "The grapes for this impressive Aussie-style Shiraz, from Lodi and Clarksburg, are ripe; the palate boasts has rich flavors of cherries, black raspberries, blueberries and plums. Feels succulent, with a smooth texture and a long, sweetish finish, but it's perfectly dry. At this price, you can't go wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "13\n",
      "With its black plum, blackberry and other bold, juvenile aromas, this bargain-priced Spaniard shows flavors of chocolate, natural bitterness and good overall balance. A little big and brawny, but better than washed out and weak. A classic chorizo or hamburger wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "Flat and soupy, as if the life had been drained out of it. Barely acceptable, even with a big production of 40,000 cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "17\n",
      "Very sweet, with cherry cola and licorice nibs comprising the nose. It's nothing more than simple Garnacha, which means it's all about red fruit and sunshine. Not a fine wine, but good for those with a sweet tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "Smells pleasant, with plum, blackberry and oak notes, but turns rather thin and tannic in the mouth. Very dry, with some fruit and herb flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "Not too many wineries bother with Chenin any more; a shame, since it grows so well in Washington's desert climate. Covey's off-dry version retains the honeyed floral characteristics of Loire Valley versions, but beefs up the fruit with juicy flavors of melon, sweet pear and honeysuckle.\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "Smells like young, gangly wine. Bubble gum and Kool-Aid aromas get only more grapy, while the palate is jumpy and aggressive. Lots of wild berry flavor, earth, herbal overtones and heat. Devoid of any sophistication.\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "Green bean and bell pepper aromas, then red pepper and more green pepper to the palate, which does offer some plum and berry. Finishes with red pepper flake. Not impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "23\n",
      "Wild and foxy smelling, but attractive and authentic. Clover, apricot and fresh melon aromas give this an enticing bouquet, while the palate is deep and delicious, with integrated flavors of orange, peach and botrytis. Long and smooth on the finish, and a steal for the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "24\n",
      "Soft, fruity and simple, with upfront flavors of bubble gum and  vanilla. Finishes slightly sweet and clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "25\n",
      "Of all the Cavas made by Freixenet, this oddly sweet Spumante is the weakest. This is briny, pickled and candied on the nose, with hints of lychee and banana. Flavors of Sprite, cane sugar and banana finish with sulfur, honeydew and a faux kiwi note.\n",
      "\n",
      "26\n",
      "This is a straightforward, regular Cab with berry/cherry aromas and flavors. Nothing is out of the ordinary; the palate is bright and focused on simple berry flavors, while the finish has proper feel, lift and power. Shows a good mixture of fruit, acid and tannin.\n",
      "\n",
      "27\n",
      "Here's a fun and fresh Italian Pinot Grigio with piquant aromas of citrus and peach. The wine is informal and easy-drinking. A good food pairing would be chicken salad or lightly roasted fish. Screwcap.\n",
      "\n",
      "28\n",
      "It is called Point West because Estremadura's vineyards are the furthest west in Europe. The wine itself is soft and fruity initially, but then there is a tight tannic texture, followed by black currant fruits. The wine is finely made, elegant, just on the warm side of cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "29\n",
      "Raspy cherry aromas precede a scratchy palate that's characterized by its high acid-to-body ratio. It tastes a bit tart and generic, with a red plum flavor in front of a fiery finish. This is light and crisp in style.\n",
      "\n",
      "30\n",
      "Cocoa, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by creamy-feeling blue-fruit flavors that display a mixture of fruit and barrel. The barrel influence is heavy, but it's delicious all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "31\n",
      "Simple and dry, this Cabernet has modest blackberry, tea and oak flavors. With its firm tannins, it gets the basic Cabernet job done.\n",
      "\n",
      "32\n",
      "A terrific example of Corbières terroir at an unbeatable price. The wine, a traditional Rhône-style blend of Syrah, Grenache and Carignan, is so loaded with aromas and flavors of the surrounding garrigue you might think that they threw in a bouquet garni during maturation. Sage, rosemary,menthol, thyme and bay leaves all abound while rich, dark fruit and oak aging (Élevé en Fûts de Chêne means aged in oak barrels) provides support and structure. Silky texture, approachable tannins and a long finish bring it all together.\n",
      "\n",
      "33\n",
      "The 2007 vintage was a hot one and La Vignone delivers all the jammy, mature fruit tones you'd expect in an immediate and upfront manner. Aromas of strawberry and blackberry preserves are backed by sour, almost sharp acidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "34\n",
      "Herbal and fruity all at once with clean aromas of gooseberry, hard mango and green grass. Ctirus flavors dominate the lightweight mouth with crisp lime acidity charging through on the close.\n",
      "\n",
      "35\n",
      "This lovely wine captures the floral, perfumed essence of the grape in a restrained, sippable style. It's dry and crisp, with lemony fruit and the delicate sensation that you are drinking fresh flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "A bit stalky on the nose, with tropical aromas and lychee. The palate is a little broken down and heavy, with flat citrus and lychee flavors. Finishes wan, with dried apricot notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "37\n",
      "This is an interesting, outright strange wine that opens with a full golden color and an aromatic veil of smoke, dust or chalky mineral over exotic fruit and peach. One item out of place is the alcohol, which emerges strong in the mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "38\n",
      "Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "39\n",
      "The opening aromas of reedy berries are gritty and crusty, while the palate is lively but feels snappy and raw. Flavors of cherry and plum are light, while the finish is straightforward, with a citrusy kick. Not as full and generous as past vintages.\n",
      "\n",
      "40\n",
      "Celery and raw wood in the nose, then some light, green fruits come into play in the mouth. As it breathes open there are floral overtones and a hint of honey—a glimmer of varietal character.\n",
      "\n",
      "41\n",
      "The aromas are the thing here, as so often with Touriga Nacional, keeping the soft tannins and ripe, sweet fruit buoyant and lively. There is acidity, but there's more, maybe too much, of blackberry jam flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "42\n",
      "Sometimes all you need is an inexpensive red like this one. This Lodi Syrah erupts in white pepper aromas and is tartly crisp in cherry and blackberry flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "43\n",
      "A bitter wine with tart apple and pear flavors, this has a hard edge. Drink now.\n",
      "\n",
      "44\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon, Alicante Bouchet and Merlot are blended to produce this exciting wine from Capalbio in southern Tuscany. The wine is smooth and firm, with notes of blackberry, cherry -liqueur and exotic spice.\n",
      "\n",
      "45\n",
      "A creamed pear wine, with an attractive tang of orange zest. It is light, bright, vibrant, very fruity. The acidity does seem to be excessive, so give this wine a few months in bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "46\n",
      "Give this young Bordeaux blend a good decanting to let it breathe and mellow. Right out of the bottle, it's drily tannic. But it shows generous blackberry, black cherry, currant, anise and cedar flavors. Now–2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "47\n",
      "Trutina is a balanced blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 23% Syrah and 5% Cab Franc. It has a pleasant blend of light berry fruits, some citrusy acidity and well-integrated tannins. A suggestion of earth and herb adds interest; it's a smooth, easy-drinking, ready-to-go red.\n",
      "\n",
      "48\n",
      "Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "49\n",
      "Cedar, cassis and blueberry aromas open this mid-weight Bordeaux-style red. An even, lean mouthfeel, red-berry, cocoa, and  mineral flavors, and silky tannins round out the package. This blend of 78%Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc finishes dry, with tart-sweet flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "50\n",
      "Rich and dry, with a wealth of blackberry and cherry tart flavors, straight from the oven with the smoky-sweet, cinnamon and burnt butter tang of the crust. You'll notice the tannins, which lend a stimulating structure. This isn't one of those blockbuster cult Merlots, just a red wine of impeccable proportions that yearns to wash down elegant fare.\n",
      "\n",
      "51\n",
      "88–90. Barrel sample. This is an herbaceous wine that's very crisp and citrusy. Pear and spice flavors add a warmer element, while the aftertaste has a mineral texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "52\n",
      "Blue flower, underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather and mature black fruit aromas lead the nose on the structured but polished Taurasi from Fratelli Urciuolo. The balanced palate doles out juicy black cherry, black plum, black pepper and thyme alongside fresh acidity and a solid tannic backbone. Give it time to develop additional complexity; drink after 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "53\n",
      "Pure Syrah from the best blocks of the estate vineyard, this is dusty and detailed, with dark berry fruits, light herb, earth and cocoa. Balanced and long, it finishes with ripe and precisely etched tannins, putting a frame around the picture-perfect expression of Walla Walla Syrah.\n",
      "\n",
      "54\n",
      "Paraiso's West Terrace Pinot is one of the secrets of the appellation. The wine exemplifies Santa Lucia with big, bold cherry pie, cola, mocha and spice flavors, bright acidity, and voluptuous tannins. Despite the size, it never loses elegance and finesse.\n",
      "\n",
      "55\n",
      "Straddles the line between villages-type and premier cru Pinot. Light in color and body, one minute it seems simple and fruity, the next, it shows the complex dimensions of a fine young Burgundy. Hard to tell where it's headed, but it's a dry, crisp, silky wine, with lip-smacking cherry, cola and oak flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "56\n",
      "With its 18 months wood aging, this is a velvety smooth wine, layering its fruits easily and with plenty of ripeness. The tannins and fresh, red-fruit acidity all fit into the roundness of this generous wine. Only the dry, spicy aftertaste suggests aging potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "57\n",
      "A high toast wine, the fruit and fresh acidity submerged beneath the wood. At the present, it is hard to enjoy, but in 2–3 years the fruit will kick in. It would be good if the producer had been less enthusiastic about the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "58\n",
      "Half Cabernet Sauvignon, and half Syrah, this vintage of Protagonist is entirely different (in both blend and vineyard sources) from the 2007. Sharp and peppery from the cool vintage Syrah, it introduces intriguing scents and accents of cayenne and bitter chocolate. The herbal flavors are more evident than in the other J. Bookwalter releases from 2008, but well blended and balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "59\n",
      "Aromas of spice, lees and ripe pear are followed by creamy feeling tropical fruit flavors, with pineapple in the lead. It doesn't quite all come together but provides plenty of intrigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "60\n",
      "As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet. The flavor profile offers cured meat, leather, graphite and plenty of blackberry, mocha, caramel and coffee. Beautiful modern Rioja. 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "61\n",
      "Each spring, Sicily is covered with bushes of wild fennel and if you pay close attention you can smell its pungent fragrance on this 100% Cabernet. You'll also get generous notes of sage, green herb, red cherry, exotic spice, smoke, vanilla and toasted almond. This is a well-made and concentrated wine with tight tannins and an overall chewy quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "62\n",
      "A great celebration of the fine 2004 vintage, this wine reveals both generosity and a steely resolve. It has a cool elegance as well, giving it a sense of refinement, while still preserving the Roederer richness. The tight acidity holds the wine together and promises long aging.\n",
      "\n",
      "63\n",
      "A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It displays the qualities of dryness and yeastiness, with complex flavors of limes, vanilla and a touch of raspberry. The mousse is very fine, while the acidity is extraordinarily clean and brisk. Beautiful now, and should age for many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "64\n",
      "When Silvia Heinrich, Johann Heinrich's daughter (whose name is on this bottle) pushes the alcohol up to 14%, she somehow loses the intense varietal character. What we find instead is a powerful wine, with layers of wood, big spice and pepper and rounded black fruits, but one with no sense of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "65\n",
      "This is pure Merlot from 10-year-old vines. Lush and chocolaty, it offers a broad, ripe and appealing set of seamless black fruit flavors. Powerful and high-toned, this adds licorice and mocha to the expansive finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "66\n",
      "Made using 50% Barbera and 50% Alicante Bouschet, this wine is fragrant and full-bodied, with notes of toasty oak and leather. The blend spent more than a year in new French oak, and it shows, both in terms of taste and structure. Should be an interesting wine over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "67\n",
      "Enormously tannic and effectively shut down now, this nonetheless is a big, potent, dry wine that's explosive in ripe, plush Cabernet fruit flavor, and generously oaked. The finish is so sweet, so delicious. The idea clearly is an ageable mountain Cab and Beringer seems to have succeeded. Hold until 2008, at the earliest.\n",
      "\n",
      "68\n",
      "Deep and dense wine, with beet, floral and black fruit aromas. The palate offers good acidity, balance, richness and complexity, while the flavor profile of raspberry, plum and dry herbs is attractive. Finishes mildly toasty, with a hint of herbs and tomato. Best from 2011–14.\n",
      "\n",
      "69\n",
      "94-96 Barrel sample. A wine that is so concentrated and dense, spiked with acidity, dry botrytis and soft final fruit. It is definitly rich, not essentially sweet, but a power-packed wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "70\n",
      "The complexity starts with dusty mineral tones that slowly segue into perfectly mature blackberry, balsam tones and spicy oak notes at the end. It is that amazing evolution of aromas, which reads like a storybook of Tuscany, that makes this wine a standout.\n",
      "\n",
      "71\n",
      "Wenzel's top cuvée is frighteningly expensive, but there's no denying the quality. Intensely botrytized aromas of dried apricots billow from the glass, accented by hints of toast, vanilla and coconut from aging in new oak barrels. Round and mouthfilling, it is very sweet, but with just enough acid to provide a semblance of balance. Dried apricot flavors dominate, but there's also superripe apple and melon flavors, while hints of spice and citrus emerge on the long finish. A worthy successor to the 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "72\n",
      "A challenging wine, one whose future is hard to predict. The immediate impact is very rich and ripe, with flavors of milk chocolate, blackberry jam and caramelized oak. In the mouth it feels soft and yielding. Not entirely satisfactory now, so the score reflects potential beyond 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "73\n",
      "The new Rubicon, which is almost all Cabernet Sauvignon, brings to mind the 2003 and 2004. It doesn't have the sheer force of 2002 or 2005, but it's certainly a classic Rutherford wine, and has a good future. Bone dry, it shows herb-infused flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and smoky sandalwood, and yes, the tannins are dusty. Drinkable now, with a good decant, and should develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "74\n",
      "A superb wine, elegance and weight combined magisterially. It has all the right mature flavors, ripe fruit, intense marmalade and concentration. This is a wine with a great reputation, and the taste doesn't let that reputation down. Imported by Kobrand.\n",
      "\n",
      "75\n",
      "Explosively rich and unctuous, this verges on being fat and overblown, then takes a few mincing steps back from the edge. Grilled apricot and peach flavors coat the palate, coming to a climax on the long, oily, fruit-filled   finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "76\n",
      "Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "77\n",
      "Pajé is a beautiful amphitheater of vines in Barbaresco known for finesse and elegance. This older vintage maintains very good integrity of fruit that is enhanced by layers of black licorice, mineral notes, ash, tobacco and cola. But at the heart of it all is a blast of red cherry. It's a vertical, intense and streamlined wine that is ready to drink now.\n",
      "\n",
      "78\n",
      "Fresh and juicy, with bright acidity and some solid tannins. Flavors of spice accompany an edge of green fruit. The aftertaste is tannins and wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "79\n",
      "From the lesser-quality 2006 vintage, this is a gentle and tangy selection. It has lemon zest and steely acidity, with light touches of grapefruit and crisp apple. Not for aging, this is an attractive wine to drink now.\n",
      "\n",
      "80\n",
      "A very buttery wine, it is soft, smooth and creamy in texture. Contrasting citrus flavors add a crisp touch. The acidity winds through the ripe fruit to give a bright edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "81\n",
      "Located in the northern end of Chambolle-Musigny, Bonnes Mares shows much of the same structure as Morey-Saint-Denis. This 2010 has so much weight and concentration, and it bears red fruit flavors and bright acids. It has a tannic side as well, which promises that this wine will age.\n",
      "\n",
      "82\n",
      "The vintage brings out the tension of this magisterial Chardonnay, and it layers nervy acidity with fresh apple and peach flavors and intense minerality. It is poised and ready to develop over many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "83\n",
      "Astralis has become one of Australia's top collectibles, and Roman Bratasiuk's 2005 version is once again top-shelf stuff. It's full-bodied and rich without being over the top, balancing dark-chocolate-covered blackberries and blueberries with more complex savory notes (spice, grilled meat). While it's a big, hulking wine at first, the finish shows great elegance and finesse, ending with silky tannins. Best from 2014. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.\n",
      "\n",
      "84\n",
      "Perhaps a step behind Weil's other supersweet 2009s, this eiswein remains a prodigious effort. The candied pineapple and golden raisin notes are so intense, so concentrated that they're almost painful to taste, lingering virtually forever on the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "85\n",
      "The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors. And then there is minerality and a tight, structured aftertaste as a reminder that this great Champagne is always going to be more than its fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "86\n",
      "This wine shows growing intensity the longer it stays in the glass and a very silky, polished feel in the mouth. Aromas include red fruit, spice and rosemary: this is a beautiful, balanced wine that will have a long life in your cellar.\n",
      "\n",
      "87\n",
      "Here's a big, flashy, cult-style wine if ever there was one. It offers masses of blackberries, black currants, coffee, spices and new oak. Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins. Yet it should age effortlessly through 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "88\n",
      "A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated. A restrained edge provides complexity and balance. It will need aging, so don't drink before 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "89\n",
      "This is a beautifully shaped wine that rises from a quiet opening. Muted and slightly closed up at this stage, it opens opulently but with balanced acidity and crispness, as well as richness and restrained power.\n",
      "\n",
      "90\n",
      "With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "91\n",
      "The palate opens slowly, offering an initial citrus character, followed by wood and then, finally, wonderfully rich, but taut fruit. There is still a toast character here, with apricots and pear on top of the citrus, but it is still only just developing. In 10–15 years, it will be a magnificent wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "92\n",
      "This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.\n",
      "\n",
      "93\n",
      "Biondi-Santi performs exceptionally well in elegant vintages like 2006. This wine is balanced and fresh, with lingering notes of wild berry, white cherry, cola, spice and dark chocolate. Age this wine 10 years or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "94\n",
      "This was a great vintage Port year, and this white Port, which was bottled in 2015, has hints of the firm tannins and structure that marked out the year. It also has preserved an amazing amount of freshness still suggesting orange marmalade flavors. These are backed up by the fine, concentrated old wood tastes. The wine is, of course, ready to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "95\n",
      "Wet earth, rain-wet stones, damp moss, wild sage and very ripe pear make for a complex opening. Further sniffs reveal more citrus: both juice and zest of lemon. The palate still holds a lot of leesy yeast flavors but its phenolic richness is tempered by total citrus freshness. This is still tightly wound; leave it so it can come into its own. The warming resonance on the palate suggests it has a long future. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "96\n",
      "The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated.\n",
